\section{Introduction}

If we have an equation $x'' + \frac{c}{m} x' + \frac{k}{m} x = 0$
By change of variables, we can write this equation as $ y'' + 2p y' + \omega_0^2 y = 0 $.
We can write this because $k >= 0$ and $m > 0$ so it is a square of some real number $\omega_0$.

The characteristic equation is  $r^2 + 2p r +  \omega_0^2$.
So the roots are :
$$ r = -p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - \omega_0^2} $$

{\bf Case 1 : } $p = 0$ means that oscillations are undamped.

So the roots are  $\pm i \omega_0$.
And the solutions are $c_1\cos \omega_0 t + c_2 \sin \omega_0 t$

{\bf Case 2 : } $p^2 - \omega_0^2 < 0$ means we have damped oscillations.

Since $p$ and $\omega_0$ are positive so we have $p < \omega_0$.
So the roots are $r = -p \pm i \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - p^2}$
So the period of this function is $\omega_1 = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - p^2}$.

And the general solutions looks like $e^{-pt}(c_1 \cos (\omega_1 t) + c_2 \sin (\omega_1 t))$

We can also write it as $Ae^{-pt}\cos(\omega_1 t - \phi)$.
So the angle after with cosine crosses the axis is $\pi$ so the time period will be $\frac{\pi}{\omega_1}$.

There are four variables in the solution :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $p = \frac{c}{2m}$ - Depends on the ODE
    \item $\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0 - p^2}$  - Depends on the ODE
    \item $A$ - Depends on the Initial Conditions
    \item $\phi$ - Depends on the Initial Conditions
\end{enumerate}

Thus, only two parameters depend on the initial condition.
